        Welcome to Finder, your one stop shop for finding, creating, and registering for events. 
        Here, you can search for various events that others have created under the "Search Events" page, 
        or you can create your own events under the "Manage Events" page. You can also see the events you've 
        registered for under the "Registered Events" page.
